- M3U account info metric for account metadata
- `dispatcharr_active_streams` now breaks down by `type="live"` and `type="vod"`
- `type` label added to several stream metrics (fps, bitrates, channel number, stream index, available streams)
- Client metrics now include `user_id` and `username` labels
- Stopping the server now prevents auto-start from restarting it
- Legacy metrics and the `Include Legacy Metric Formats` setting have been removed
- `Check for Updates` action and `Disable Update Notifications` setting removed
- Requires Dispatcharr v0.22.0 or later

- The dashboard session counts now include recording sessions, with per-server breakdowns showing live vs. DVR counts and a DVR badge on affected channel cards

**Installing**: This plugin is available in the "Get Plugins" section of your Dispatcharr installation.
